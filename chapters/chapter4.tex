Aristotle giveth the Cause, vainely, why the Feathers of Birds are of more lively Colours, then the Haires of Beasts. ... He saith, It is, because Birds are more in the Beames of the Sunne, then Beasts; But that is manifestly untrue; For Cattle are more in the Sun than Birds, that live commonly in the Woods, or in some Covert. The true Cause is, that the Excrementious Moisture of living Creatures, which maketh as well the Feathers in Birds, as the Haires in Beasts, passeth in Birds through a finer and more delicate Strainer, than it doth in Beastes: For Feathers passe through Quills; and Haire through Skin.
