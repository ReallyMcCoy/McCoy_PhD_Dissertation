abstract = {Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, but emotional states are difficult to directly assess in animals. Researchers have assessed pain using behavioural and physiological measures, but these approaches are limited to understanding the arousal rather than valence of the emotional experience. Cognitive bias tasks show that depressed humans judge ambiguous events negatively and this technique has been applied to assess emotional states in animals. However, limited research has examined how pain states affect cognitive processes in animals. Here we present the first evidence of cognitive bias in response to pain in any non-human species. In two experiments, dairy calves (n = 17) were trained to respond differentially to red and white video screens and then tested with unreinforced ambiguous colours in two or three test sessions before and two sessions after the routine practice of hot-iron disbudding. After disbudding calves were more likely to judge ambiguous colours as negative. This 'pessimistic' bias indicates that post-operative pain following hot-iron disbudding results in a negative change in emotional state.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Biologists have long debated the evolution of animal ornamentation via female choice. Much of the discussion of ornament evolution has focused on three hypotheses: the species recognition hypothesis, the indicator trait hypothesis, and the runaway sexual selection hypothesis. These models of sexual selection have generally been considered in isolation, with each assessed as a potential complete explanation for ornament evolution. In fact, any choosing female potentially benefits by assessing three distinct characteristics of a prospective mate—species identity, individual condition, and sexiness—such that there can be no comprehensive explanation of ornamentation without consideration of the need for females to assess these three key attributes of males. There is no logical basis for advocating for the importance of one of these classes of information over another. Consideration that all three assessments of prospective males work in tandem to shape the evolution of female preferences for male ornaments leads to a better understanding of the diversity of ornamentation within and among animal species.},

abstract = {Diet has been known to play an important role in human health since at least the time period of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates. In the last decade, research has revealed that microorganisms inhabiting the digestive tract, known as the gut microbiota, are critical factors in human health. This paper draws on concepts of cooperation and conflict from ecology and evolutionary biology to make predictions about host–microbiota interactions involving nutrients. To optimally extract energy from some resources (e.g., fiber), hosts require cooperation from microbes. Other nutrients can be utilized by both hosts and microbes (e.g., simple sugars, iron) in their ingested form, which may lead to greater conflict over these resources. This framework predicts that some negative health effects of foods are driven by the direct effects of these foods on human physiology and by indirect effects resulting from microbiome–host competition and conflict (e.g., increased invasiveness and inflammation). Similarly, beneficial effects of some foods on host health may be enhanced by resource sharing and other cooperative behaviors between host and microbes that may downregulate inflammation and virulence. Given that some foods cultivate cooperation between hosts and microbes while others agitate conflict, host–microbe interactions may be novel targets for interventions aimed at improving nutrition and human health.},

abstract = {Carotenoid coloration is widely recognized as a signal of individual condition in various animals, but despite decades of study, the mechanisms that link carotenoid coloration to condition remain unresolved. Most birds with red feathers convert yellow dietary carotenoids to red carotenoids in an oxidation process requiring the gene encoding the putative cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2J19. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the process of carotenoid oxidation and feather pigmentation is functionally linked to mitochondrial performance. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed high levels of red ketolated carotenoids associated with the hepatic mitochondria of moulting wild house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus), and upon fractionation, we found the highest concentration of ketolated carotenoids in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We further found that the redness of growing feathers was positively related to the performance of liver mitochondria. Structural modelling of CYP2J19 supports a direct role of this protein in carotenoid ketolation that may be functionally linked to cellular respiration. These observations suggest that feather coloration serves as a signal of core functionality through inexorable links to cellular respiration in the mitochondria.},

abstract = {Emotions can bias human decisions- for example depressed or anxious people tend to make pessimistic judgements while those in positive affective states are often more optimistic. Several studies have reported that affect contingent judgement biases can also be produced in animals. The animals, however, cannot self-report; therefore, the valence of their emotions, to date, could only be assumed. Here we present the results of an experiment where the affect-contingent judgement bias has been produced by objectively measured positive emotions. We trained rats in operant Skinner boxes to press one lever in response to one tone to receive a food reward and to press another lever in response to a different tone to avoid punishment by electric foot shock. After attaining a stable level of discrimination performance, the animals were subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation - tickling. This procedure has been confirmed to induce a positive affective state in rats, and the 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (rat laughter) emitted by animals in response to tickling have been postulated to index positive emotions akin to human joy. During the tickling and handling sessions, the numbers of emitted high-frequency 50-kHz calls were scored. Immediately after tickling or handling, the animals were tested for their responses to a tone of intermediate frequency, and the pattern of their responses to this ambiguous cue was taken as an indicator of the animals' optimism. Our findings indicate that tickling induced positive emotions which are directly indexed in rats by laughter, can make animals more optimistic. We demonstrate for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model. We also introduce innovative tandem-approach for studying emotional-cognitive interplay in animals, which may be of great value for understanding the emotional-cognitive changes associated with mood disorders.},

abstract = {"The main task of this book is to explain how the process of natural selection produces purposeful beings that make sense of their world - organisms who do things for good reasons. It provides a link between a physical world described in terms of matter in motion and a living world described in terms of meanings and purposes. David is proposing a unification of biology and the humanities through a shared engagement with questions of purpose and meaning. From the Introduction: Spoken and written language are the expression of deep inner structures. The language that is censored says something about the values and fears of the censor. This book pays close attention to the meanings of words for four main reasons. The first is that languages evolve and provide useful analogies for thinking about genetic evolution. The second is that meaning is the outcome of a process of interpretation and is specific to each interpreter. The same words will be interpreted differently and mean different things for each reader. As a result many acrimonious disputes in the philosophy of biology are really quibbling about definitions rather than disputes about facts. The third is that the origin of language marked an extraordinary expansion in the lexical expressivity of the flux of meaning. The fourth, and most important, is that the beauty and diversity of language, like the beauty and diversity of the natural world, are wonders to behold. Natural selection reuses old materials for new purposes. Its products are thereby comprised of parts of variable age that nevertheless must work together in some more-or-less coherent fashion. The resulting genomes are pastiche and so is this book. Its bricolage extends to the extensive use of quotations and paraphrase. Finally, I believe that the humanities and sciences have much to say to each other, so I wished to express my ideas in a style that would engage both audiences at the risk of enraging both and being ignored by both. Much of the prose was originally written under the constraints of meeting the selective criteria of scientific reviewers, and it shows.

Here, we explore the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals, and could be used as novel measures of animal welfare. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that wild-caught captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are more optimistic in their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli when they are housed in cages designed to promote greater welfare compared with when they are housed in standard laboratory cages. Starlings were trained using a choice procedure to discriminate between two temporal stimuli (2 s versus 10 s duration light stimulus) associated with outcomes of a different value (instant or delayed food). Next, the birds' responses to ambiguous, unreinforced stimuli of intermediate duration ranging from 2 to 10 s were examined under two housing regimes designed to manipulate the birds' welfare: big enriched cages versus standard cages (smaller and unenriched). The birds' probability of classifying an intermediate stimulus as that associated with the instant food outcome was significantly higher in the enriched cage compared with the standard cage. Thus, the birds displayed greater optimism in the face of uncertainty under housing conditions in which other measures indicate better welfare. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing affective state in non-human animals. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It has recently been suggested that biases in information processing may offer a novel means of understanding animal emotions. Anxious and depressed people tend to interpret ambiguous information negatively. We explored the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals and could therefore be used as novel measures of animal welfare. We used a novel cognitive bias task based on a learnt taste aversion to determine whether birds deprived of environmental enrichment show biases in their classification of ambiguous signals. We hypothesised that starlings in enriched cages should be more likely to classify ambiguous signals as being associated with a positive outcome than starlings housed in standard, unenriched cages. Starlings were trained on a go/no-go procedure to discriminate between two visual stimuli (cardboard lids of white and dark grey) associated with outcomes of a different value (palatable and unpalatable mealworms hidden underneath). Individual birds' responses to unreinforced, intermediate stimuli (various shades of grey between white and dark grey) were subsequently examined while each bird was housed sequentially in both standard and enriched cages. The probability of a bird classifying an ambiguous pale grey lid as hiding a palatable mealworm was lower in standard cages than enriched cages, but this difference was found only in birds that received enriched cages first. Our results can be interpreted as showing a pessimistic bias in birds that have recently experienced a decline in environmental quality. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing welfare in non-human animals.},

abstract = {Whether animals experience human-like emotions is controversial and of immense societal concern [1-3]. Because animals cannot provide subjective reports of how they feel, emotional state can only be inferred using physiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures [4-8]. In humans, negative feelings are reliably correlated with pessimistic cognitive biases, defined as the increased expectation of bad outcomes [9-11]. Recently, mammals [12-16] and birds [17-20] with poor welfare have also been found to display pessimistic-like decision making, but cognitive biases have not thus far been explored in invertebrates. Here, we ask whether honeybees display a pessimistic cognitive bias when they are subjected to an anxiety-like state induced by vigorous shaking designed to simulate a predatory attack. We show for the first time that agitated bees are more likely to classify ambiguous stimuli as predicting punishment. Shaken bees also have lower levels of hemolymph dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin. In demonstrating state-dependent modulation of categorization in bees, and thereby a cognitive component of emotion, we show that the bees' response to a negatively valenced event has more in common with that of vertebrates than previously thought. This finding reinforces the use of cognitive bias as a measure of negative emotional states across species and suggests that honeybees could be regarded as exhibiting emotions.

abstract = {Affective states influence decision-making under ambiguity in humans and other animals. Individuals in a negative state tend to interpret ambiguous cues more negatively than individuals in a positive state. We demonstrate that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , also exhibits state-dependent changes in cue interpretation. Drosophila were trained on a Go/Go task to approach a positive (P) odour associated with a sugar reward and actively avoid a negative (N) odour associated with shock. Trained flies were then either shaken to induce a purported negative state or left undisturbed (control), and given a choice between: air or P; air or N; air or ambiguous odour (1 : 1 blend of P : N). Shaken flies were significantly less likely to approach the ambiguous odour than control flies. This ‘judgement bias' may be mediated by changes in neural activity that reflect evolutionarily primitive affective states. We cannot say whether such states are consciously experienced, but use of this model organism's versatile experimental tool kit may facilitate elucidation of their neural and genetic basis.},

abstract = {Pregnancy has commonly been viewed as a cooperative interaction between a mother and her fetus. The effects of natural selection on genes expressed in fetuses, however, may be opposed by the effects of natural selection on genes expressed in mothers. In this sense, a genetic conflict can be said to exist between maternal and fetal genes. Fetal genes will be selected to increase the transfer of nutrients to their fetus, and maternal genes will be selected to limit transfers in excess of some maternal optimum. Thus a process of evolutionary escalation is predicted in which fetal actions are opposed by maternal countermeasures. The phenomenon of genomic imprinting means that a similar conflict exists within fetal cells between genes that are expressed when maternally derived, and genes that are expressed when paternally derived. During implantation, fetally derived cells (trophoblast) invade the maternal endometrium and remodel the endometrial spiral arteries into low-resistance vessels that are unable to constrict. This invasion has three consequences. First, the fetus gains direct access to its mother's arterial blood. Therefore, a mother cannot reduce the nutrient content of blood reaching the placenta without reducing the nutrient supply to her own tissues. Second, the volume of blood reaching the placenta becomes largely independent of control by the local maternal vasculature. Third, the placenta is able to release hormones and other substances directly into the maternal circulation. Placental hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (hPL), are predicted to manipulate maternal physiology for fetal benefit. For example, hPL is proposed to act on maternal prolactin receptors to increase maternal resistance to insulin. If unopposed, the effect of hPL would be to maintain higher blood glucose levels for longer periods after meals. This action, however, is countered by increased maternal production of insulin. Gestational diabetes develops if the mother is unable to mount an adequate response to fetal manipulation. Similarly, fetal genes are predicted to enhance the flow of maternal blood through the placenta by increasing maternal blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be interpreted as an attempt by a poorly nourished fetus to increase its supply of nutrients by increasing the resistance of its mother's peripheral circulation.},

abstract = {Some of the most vivid colors in the animal kingdom are created not by pigments, but by wavelength-selective scattering of light from nanostructures. Here we investigate quasi-ordered nanostructures of avian feather barbs which produce vivid non-iridescent colors. These $\beta$-keratin and air nanostructures are found in two basic morphologies: tortuous channels and amorphous packings of spheres. Each class of nanostructure is isotropic and has a pronounced characteristic length scale of variation in composition. These local structural correlations lead to strong backscattering over a narrow range of optical frequencies and little variation with angle of incidence. Such optical properties play important roles in social and sexual communication. To be effective, birds need to precisely control the development of these nanoscale structures, yet little is known about how they grow. We hypothesize that multiple lineages of birds have convergently evolved to exploit phase separation and kinetic arrest to self-assemble spongy color-producing nanostructures in feather barbs. Observed avian nanostructures are strikingly similar to those self-assembled during the phase separation of fluid mixtures; the channel and sphere morphologies are characteristic of phase separation by spinodal decomposition and nucleation and growth, respectively. These unstable structures are locked-in by the kinetic arrest of the $\beta$-keratin matrix, likely through the entanglement or cross-linking of supermolecular $\beta$-keratin fibers. Using the power of self-assembly, birds can robustly realize a diverse range of nanoscopic morphologies with relatively small physical and chemical changes during feather development. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Intergenerational transfer of wealth has been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the evolution of human sibling relationships. Sibling rivalry is assumed to be more marked when offspring compete for limited heritable resources, which are crucial for reproductive success (e.g., land and livestock); whereas in the absence of heritable wealth, related siblings may cooperate. To date, comparative studies undertaken to support this evolutionary assumption have been confounded by other socioecological factors, which vary across populations, e.g., food sharing and intergroup conflict. In this article we explore effects of sibling competition and cooperation for agricultural resources, marriage, and reproduction in one contemporary Ethiopian agropastoralist society. Here recent changes in land tenure policy, altering transfers of land from parents to offspring, present a unique framework to test the importance of intergenerational transfers of wealth in driving sibling competition, while controlling for socioeconomic biases. In households where land is inherited, the number of elder brothers reduces a man's agricultural productivity, marriage, and reproductive success, as resources diminish and competition increases with each additional sibling. Where land is not inherited (for males receiving land directly from the government and all females) older siblings do not have a competitive effect and in some instances may be beneficial. This study has wider implications for the evolution of human family sizes. Recent changes in wealth transfers, which have driven sibling competition, may be contributing to an increased desire for smaller family sizes.},

Some owners perceive their dog to be ‘fine' or even ‘happy' when performing SRB [3], a few seek professional help [1], and others relinquish the dog [4]. Given the magnitude of the issue and the varied perceptions and behaviour of owners, the underlying emotional (affective) states of dogs showing SRB, and hence their welfare, requires elucidation. Whilst most dogs are believed to be anxious when showing SRB [1,2], it is uncertain whether their background affective state (mood) when they are not separated is also negative [1]. Here we use a new ‘cognitive bias' measure of animal affect to show that dogs which exhibit high levels of SRB in a separation test also appear to have a more negative underlying mood.},

We revealed a unique hierarchical pattern of leaf-like microstructures striated with nanoridges on the snake scales that coincides with the distribution of black colouration. Velvet black sites demonstrate four times lower reflectance and higher absorbance than other scales in the UV-near IR spectral range. The combination of surface structures impeding reflectance and absorbing dark pigments, deposited in the skin material, provides reflecting less than 11% of the light reflected by a polytetrafluoroethylene diffuse reflectance standard in any direction.

We test for potential drivers of the evolution of seasonal plumage colours in all passerines (N = 5901 species, c. 60% of all birds). Seasonal plumage colours are uncommon, having appeared on multiple occasions but more frequently lost during evolution. The trait is more common in small, ground-foraging species with polygynous mating systems, no paternal care and strong sexual dichromatism, suggesting it evolved under strong sexual selection and high predation risk. Seasonal plumage colours are also more common in species predicted to have seasonal breeding schedules, such as migratory birds and those living in seasonal climates. We propose that seasonal plumage colours have evolved to resolve a trade-off between the effects of natural and sexual selection on colouration, especially in seasonal environments.},

abstract = {Iridescence is produced by coherent scattering of light waves from alternating layers of materials of different refractive indices. In birds, iridescent colours are produced by feather barbules when light is scattered from alternating layers of keratin, melanin and air. The structure and organization of these layers, and hence the appearance of bird species with different types of plumage iridescence, varies extensively. One principal distinction between different types of iridescent colours is whether they are produced by a single pair of layers or by multiple pairs of layers. Multi-layer iridescence, such as that displayed by hummingbirds, has been relatively well characterized, but single-layer iridescence has only recently been modeled successfully. Here we use electron microscopy, spectrometry and thin-film optical modeling to investigate the glossy, ultraviolet-blue iridescent plumage colouration of adult male satin bowerbirds Ptilonorhynchus violaceus minor. The flattened barbules of adult males are composed of a superficial keratin layer overlying a melanin layer that is several granules thick. A thin-film model based on the thickness of the keratin layer and its two associated interfaces (air/keratin and keratin/melanin) generates predicted reflectance spectra that closely match measured spectra. In addition, hues predicted from this model are positively correlated with measured hues. As predicted from our thin-film model, measured hues shifted to shorter wavelengths at increasing angles of incidence and reflectance. Moreover, we found that individual variation in barbule nanostructure can predict measured variation in both hue and UV-chroma. Thus, we have characterized the microstructure of satin bowerbird barbules, uncovered the mechanisms responsible for producing ultraviolet iridescence in these barbules, and provided the first evidence of a nanostructural basis for individual variation in iridescent plumage colour.},

We present the first evidence for two distinct mechanisms of structural color in palaeognath feathers. One extinct volant clade, Lithornithidae, shows evidence of elongate melanin-containing organelles uniquely associated with glossy/iridescent color, a structural color mechanism found in fossil outgroups and neognath birds. We also demonstrate a structural basis for the exceptional gloss in extant cassowary feathers. We propose gloss as an intermediate phenotype between matte and iridescent plumage, conferred by a thick and smooth feather rachis. Rachis-based structural color has not been previously investigated.

abstract = {Many vertebrates grow up in the company of same or different-age siblings, and relations among them can be expected to significantly influence individual life histories and the development of individual morphological, physiological, and behavioral phenotypes. Although studies in birds still dominate and have stimulated most theoretical considerations, the increasing number of mammalian studies promises to broaden our understanding of this complex field by enabling interesting comparisons with the rather different bird system. It therefore seems timely to bring together recent studies of sibling relations in mammals and to demonstrate what these can offer in the way of fresh insights. In this brief review, intended to accompany a series of papers on a diverse range of mammals, we outline the current state of sibling research in mammals, comparing it to the better studied birds. Most obviously, in mammals, mother and young are in much closer contact during early life than in birds, and siblings can influence each other's development as well as the mother's physiology while still in utero. During nursing, mammalian young also encounter a very different feeding situation to bird siblings. These contrasts should help stimulate further debate, as well as provide further opportunities to study the relative importance of maternal versus sibling effects on individual development. Finally, we discuss the need to balance studies of sibling competition and conflict with a consideration of the benefits accruing to individuals from sibling presence and the need for long-term studies of the influence of early sibling relations on individual development and life histories.},

abstract = {Mechanisms maintaining honesty of sexual signals are far from resolved, limiting our understanding of sexual selection and potential important parts of physiology. Carotenoid pigmented visual signals are among the most extensively studied sexual displays, but evidence regarding hypotheses on how carotenoids ensure signal honesty is mixed. Using a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of 357 effect sizes across 88 different species of birds, we tested two prominent hypotheses in the field: that carotenoid-dependent coloration signals i) immunocompetence and/or ii) oxidative stress state. Separate meta-analyses were performed for the relationships of trait coloration and circulating carotenoid level with different measures of immunocompetence and oxidative stress state. For immunocompetence we find that carotenoid levels (r = 0.20) and trait color intensity (r = 0.17) are significantly positively related to PHA response. Additionally we find that carotenoids are significantly positively related to antioxidant capacity (r = 0.10), but not significantly related to oxidative damage (r = -0.02). Thus our analyses provide support for both hypotheses, in that at least for some aspects of immunity and oxidative stress state the predicted correlations were found. Furthermore, we tested for differences in effect size between experimental and observational studies; a larger effect in observational studies would indicate that co-variation might not be causal. However, we detected no significant difference, suggesting that the relationships we found are causal. The overall effect sizes we report are modest and we discuss potential factors contributing to this, including differences between species. We suggest complementary mechanisms maintaining honesty rather than the involvement of carotenoids in immune function and oxidative stress and suggest experiments on how to test these.},

abstract = {Any parent has finite amounts of resources available for reproduction. The more resources supplied to an offspring, the greater should be the offspring's chances of survival and future reproduction, but the fewer resources should remain for the parent to produce other offspring. Thus, a parent could invest a small amount in each of a large number of inexpensive offspring or a large amount in each of a smaller number of offspring. Smith and Fretwell (1974) developed a simple graphic model of the selective consequences of different resource allocations among offspring. They assumed that parental investment could be represented as a single quantity and that an offspring's fitness could be expressed as a function of the investment received. Parental fitness, for a given allocation, was defined as the return in offspring fitness per unit of investment. This corresponds to the slope of a line from the origin to the appropriate point on the function. The tangent to the curve through the origin had the steepest gradient and gave the allocation to individual offspring that maximized parental fitness. Their model has been widely used and was recently formalized by Lloyd (1987).},

abstract = {A better understanding of animal emotion is an important goal in disciplines ranging from neuroscience to animal welfare science. The conscious experience of emotion cannot be assessed directly, but neural, behavioural and physiological indicators of emotion can be measured. Researchers have used these measures to characterize how animals respond to situations assumed to induce discrete emotional states (e.g. fear). While advancing our understanding of specific emotions, this discrete emotion approach lacks an overarching framework that can incorporate and integrate the wide range of possible emotional states. Dimensional approaches that conceptualize emotions in terms of universal core affective characteristics (e.g. valence (positivity versus negativity) and arousal) can provide such a framework. Here, we bring together discrete and dimensional approaches to: (i) offer a structure for integrating different discrete emotions that provides a functional perspective on the adaptive value of emotional states, (ii) suggest how long-term mood states arise from short-term discrete emotions, how they also influence these discrete emotions through a bi-directional relationship and how they may function to guide decision-making, and (iii) generate novel hypothesis-driven measures of animal emotion and mood.},

abstract = {Background: Data for the causes of maternal deaths are needed to inform policies to improve maternal health. We developed and analysed global, regional, and subregional estimates of the causes of maternal death during 2003-09, with a novel method, updating the previous WHO systematic review. Methods: We searched specialised and general bibliographic databases for articles published between between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2012, for research data, with no language restrictions, and the WHO mortality database for vital registration data. On the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, we analysed causes of maternal death from datasets. We aggregated country level estimates to report estimates of causes of death by Millennium Development Goal regions and worldwide, for main and subcauses of death categories with a Bayesian hierarchical model. Findings: We identified 23 eligible studies (published 2003-12). We included 417 datasets from 115 countries comprising 60 799 deaths in the analysis. About 73% (1 771 000 of 2 443 000) of all maternal deaths between 2003 and 2009 were due to direct obstetric causes and deaths due to indirect causes accounted for 27{\textperiodcentered}5% (672 000, 95% UI 19{\textperiodcentered}7-37{\textperiodcentered}5) of all deaths. Haemorrhage accounted for 27{\textperiodcentered}1% (661 000, 19{\textperiodcentered}9-36{\textperiodcentered}2), hypertensive disorders 14{\textperiodcentered}0% (343 000, 11{\textperiodcentered}1-17{\textperiodcentered}4), and sepsis 10{\textperiodcentered}7% (261 000, 5{\textperiodcentered}9-18{\textperiodcentered}6) of maternal deaths. The rest of deaths were due to abortion (7{\textperiodcentered}9% [193 000], 4{\textperiodcentered}7-13{\textperiodcentered}2), embolism (3{\textperiodcentered}2% [78 000], 1{\textperiodcentered}8-5{\textperiodcentered}5), and all other direct causes of death (9{\textperiodcentered}6% [235 000], 6{\textperiodcentered}5-14{\textperiodcentered}3). Regional estimates varied substantially. Interpretation: Between 2003 and 2009, haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and sepsis were responsible for more than half of maternal deaths worldwide. More than a quarter of deaths were attributable to indirect causes. These analyses should inform the prioritisation of health policies, programmes, and funding to reduce maternal deaths at regional and global levels. Further efforts are needed to improve the availability and quality of data related to maternal mortality.

In human psychology, there is evidence that affective state can alter cognition, with more positive states being associated with an increased likelihood of judging ambiguous information postively (a phenomenon described as optimistic cognitive bias). The aim of this study was to investigate whether judgement biases could be used to assess affective states in pigs housed in environments with different levels of enrichment. Two groups of five gilts were housed in either enriched (E) or barren (B) environments for the first five weeks of the experiment. The enriched group had more space, straw and objects to manipulate. The pigs were trained on a go/no-go task to discriminate two auditory cues, a positive cue that predicted a food reward if the pig approached a hatch, and a negative cue that predicted a mildly aversive experience if the pig approached the same hatch. The quality of the pigs' environment was then changed over time in a balanced, cross-over design (either EBE or BEB). Tests of cognitive bias were made on individual pigs before and after each change in environment using an unreinforced, ambiguous, auditory cue different from either the positive or the negative cue. In test sessions, positive, negative and amibiguous cues were presented in a randomised sequence, and the pigs' responses (whether they approached the hatch and latency to approach) were recorded. Both groups were more likely to approach the hatch and were faster to approach the hatch in response to the ambiguous cue when currently housed in the enriched environment. There was also an interaction between current and past environment, whereby pigs that started in the enriched environment were subsequently less likely and slower to approach the hatch when moved to a barren environment than pigs intially housed in the barren environment. These results show that pigs have more optimistic judgement biases in enriched environments indicative of a more positive affective state. Also, pigs that have spent time in an enriched environment react more negatively to being subsequently housed in a barren environment. We conclude that cognitive bias has potential to provide additional information about the effect of various management regimes on farmed animals' welfare. This will be increasingly important for identifying practices to promote positive affective states in our food producing animals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {It has been argued that females should be able to choose parasite-resistant mates on the basis of the quality of male secondary sexual characters and that such signals must be costly handicaps in order to evolve. To a large extent, handicap hypotheses have relied on energetic explanations for these costs. Here, we have presented a phenomenological model, operating on an intraspecific level, which views the cost of secondary sexual development from an endocrinological perspective. The primary androgenic hormone, testosterone, has a dualistic effect; it stimulates development of characteristics used in sexual selection while reducing immunocompetence. This "double-edged sword" creates a physiological trade-off that influences and is influenced by parasite burden. We propose a negative-feedback loop between signal intensity and parasite burden by suggesting that testosterone-dependent signal intensity is a plastic response. This response is modified in accordance with the competing demands of the potential costs of parasite infection versus that of increased reproductive success afforded by exaggerated signals. We clarify how this trade-off is intimately involved in the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics and how it may explain some of the equivocal empirical results that have surfaced in attempts to quantify parasite's effect on sexual selection.},

abstract = {Contemporary researchers regard emotional states as multifaceted, comprising physiological, behavioural, cognitive and subjective components. Subjective, conscious experience of emotion can be inferred from linguistic report in humans, but is inaccessible to direct measurement in non-human animals. However, measurement of other components of emotion is possible, and a variety of methods exist for monitoring emotional processes in animals by measuring behavioural and physiological changes. These are important tools, but they have limitations including difficulties of interpretation and the likelihood that many may be sensitive indicators of emotional arousal but not valence - pleasantness/unpleasantness. Cognitive components of emotion are a largely unexplored source of information about animal emotions, despite the fact that cognition-emotion links have been extensively researched in human cognitive science indicating that cognitive processes - appraisals of stimuli, events and situations - play an important role in the generation of emotional states, and that emotional states influence cognitive functioning by inducing attentional, memory and judgement biases. Building on this research, it is possible to design non-linguistic cognitive measures of animal emotion that may be especially informative in offering new methods for assessing emotional valence (positive as well as negative), discriminating same-valenced emotion of different types, identifying phenotypes with a cognitive predisposition to develop affective disorders, and perhaps shedding light on the issue of conscious emotional experiences in animals. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The evolution and production mechanisms of red carotenoid-based ornaments in animals are poorly understood. Recently, it has been suggested that enzymes transforming yellow carotenoids to red pigments (ketolases) in animal cells may be positioned in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) intimately linked to the electron transport chain. These enzymes may mostly synthesize coenzyme Q10 (coQ10), a key redox-cycler antioxidant molecularly similar to yellow carotenoids. It has been hypothesized that this shared pathway favours the evolution of red traits as sexually selected individual quality indices by revealing a well-adjusted oxidative metabolism. We administered mitochondria-targeted molecules to male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) measuring their bill redness, a trait produced by transforming yellow carotenoids. One molecule included coQ10 (mitoquinone mesylate, MitoQ) and the other one (decyl-triphenylphosphonium; dTPP) has the same structure without the coQ10 aromatic ring. At the highest dose, the bill colour of MitoQ and dTPP birds strongly differed: MitoQ birds' bills were redder and dTPP birds showed paler bills even compared to birds injected with saline only. These results suggest that ketolases are indeed placed at the IMM and that coQ10 antioxidant properties may improve their efficiency. The implications for evolutionary theories of sexual signalling are discussed.},

Two opposing paradigms have emerged to explain RPL. The prevailing clinical viewpoint is that RPL is caused by a spectrum of subclinical disorders, ranging from thrombophilia to anatomical, endocrine and immunological disorders, that somehow converge on a ‘fragile' early pregnancy state, leading to miscarriage. A new paradigm, based on emerging concepts around early implantation events, challenges the conventional thinking around RPL. It purports that the high incidence of embryonic aneuploidies and mosaicism coupled with a cycling endometrium necessitates the introduction of multiple ‘quality control' checkpoints in the first trimester of pregnancy to limit maternal investment in a failing pregnancy. Here we review the evidence underpinning both paradigms and examine how new thinking around RPL may lead to more effective preventative strategies.},

abstract = {The matrilineal Mosuo of southwestern China live in communal households where brothers and sisters of three generations live together (duolocal residence), and men visit their wives, who reside elsewhere, only at night in 'visiting' marriages. Here we show that these communally breeding sisters are in reproductive conflict, in the sense that they share the resources needed to reproduce. We analyse determinants of reproductive success in females and males, and show that co-resident female kin are in competition; the more female kin reside in the household, the more reproductive success is reduced. Male reproductive success, however, is not determined by the kin in his natal household; duolocal males are not in reproductive conflict with their siblings. Competition with female cousins can be worse than that between sisters. We also find that female work on the farm (which is the main communal resource) is not equal. We use a 'tug-of-war' model of reproductive skew generated by incomplete control, to model the patterns of effort put into competition between sisters and cousins. The model predicts that more dominant (older) sisters will put less effort into reproductive conflict than will less dominant (younger) sisters; but younger sisters will also have lower reproductive success because they are less efficient at gaining access to the shared resource. Both predictions are consistent with our data. Younger sisters work less in the fields than do older sisters, which may represent a form of conflict or may be because their average relatedness to the household is lower than that of their more fertile older sisters.},

abstract = {Accurate assessment of animal emotion (affect) is an important goal in animal welfare science, and in areas such as neuroscience and psychopharmacology. Direct measures of conscious emotion are not available, so assessment of animal affect has relied on measures of the behavioural and physiological components of affective states. These are important indicators but have some limitations (e.g. measuring emotional arousal rather than valence (positivity vs negativity)). Human psychology research suggests that changes in cognitive function (information processing) can also be reliable indicators of emotional state (especially valence). For example, people in negative states attend to threats, retrieve negative memories, and make negative judgements about ambiguous stimuli more than happier people. Here we review a new research area investigating the possibility that such affect-induced 'cognitive biases' also occur in animals. We focus on a novel 'judgement bias' paradigm in which animals are trained that one cue predicts a positive event and another cue predicts a less positive/negative event, and are then presented with ambiguous (intermediate) cues. The hypothesis is that animals in a negative affective state will be more likely to respond to ('judge') these ambiguous cues as if they predict the negative event (a 'pessimistic' response), than animals in a more positive state. Recent studies of rats, dogs, rhesus monkeys, starlings and humans provide face-value support for this hypothesis. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the affect manipulation treatments used in these studies, and the possibility that treatment-induced changes in feeding motivation, general activity and learning are responsible for the effects observed, and we consider whether the type of bias observed and the precise design of the judgement bias task can provide information about different types of affective state. Judgement biases may result from the influence of affect on decision-making processes including attention to and perception of the ambiguous cue, evaluation of the value and probability (expected utility) of the outcomes of different responses, and action selection. Affect might also modulate general tendencies of loss, risk and ambiguity aversion, hence biasing decisions. We discuss these possibilities in relation to theory and findings from neurobiological and psychological studies of decision-making, in order to better understand the potential mechanisms underlying judgement biases. We conclude with some specific recommendations for study design and interpretation, and suggestions for future research in this area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We used a large demographic dataset on preindustrial humans from Finland to study the effect of elder siblings on key life-history traits. The presence of elder siblings improved the chances of younger siblings surviving to sexual maturity, suggesting that despite a competition for parental resources, they may help rearing their younger siblings. After reaching sexual maturity however, same-sex elder siblings' presence was associated with reduced reproductive success in the focal individual, indicating the existence of competition among same-sex siblings. Overall, lifetime fitness was reduced by same-sex elder siblings' presence and increased by opposite-sex elder siblings' presence. Our study shows opposite effects of sibling interactions depending on the life-history stage, and highlights the need for using long-term fitness measures to understand the selection pressures acting on sibling interactions.},

abstract = { During sensitive periods in utero, gonadal steroids help organize biological sex differences in humans and other mammals. In litter-bearing species, chromosomal females passively exposed to prenatal testosterone from male littermates exhibit altered physical and behavioral traits as adults. The consequences of such effects are less well understood in humans, but recent near-doubling of twinning rates in many countries since 1980, secondary to advanced maternal age and increased reliance on in vitro fertilization, means that an increasing subset of females in many populations may be exposed to prenatal testosterone from their male co-twin. Here we use data on all births in Norway ( n = 728,842, including 13,800 twins) between 1967 and 1978 to show that females exposed in utero to a male co-twin have a decreased probability of graduating from high school (15.2%), completing college (3.9%), and being married (11.7%), and have lower fertility (5.8%) and life-cycle earnings (8.6%). These relationships remain unchanged among the subsets of 583 and 239 females whose male co-twin died during the first postnatal year and first 28 days of life, respectively, supporting the interpretation that they are due primarily to prenatal exposure rather than to postnatal socialization effects of being raised with a male sibling. Our findings provide empirical evidence, using objectively measured nation-level data, that human females exposed prenatally to a male co-twin experience long-term changes in marriage, fertility, and human capital. These findings support the hypothesis of in utero testosterone transfer between twins, which is likely affecting a small but growing subset of females worldwide. },

We have proposed that such biases may be used as indicators of animal emotional state. Here, we used a spatial judgement task, in which animals were trained to expect food in one location and not another, to determine whether rats in relatively positive or negative emotional states respond differently to ambiguous stimuli of intermediate spatial location. We housed 24 rats with environmental enrichment for 7 weeks. We removed the enrichment from half the animals prior to the start of training to induce a relatively negative emotional state, whereas we left it in place for the remaining rats. After 6 training days, the rats successfully discriminated between the rewarded and the unrewarded locations in terms of an increased latency to arrive at the unrewarded location, with no housing treatment difference. The subjects then underwent 3 days of testing in which three ambiguous 'probe' locations, intermediate between the rewarded and the unrewarded locations, were introduced. There was no difference between the treatments in the rats' judgement of two of the three probe locations, the exception being when the ambiguous probe was positioned closest to the unrewarded location. This result suggests that rats housed without enrichment, and in an assumed relatively negative emotional state, respond differently to an ambiguous stimulus compared to rats housed with enrichment, providing evidence that cognitive biases may be used to assess animal emotional state in a spatial judgement task. ?? 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Fruit set is consistently low in the genus Banksia (Proteaceae). One explanation for low fruit:flower ratios is that excess flowers allow plants to selectively abort inferior progeny thereby increasing the average quality of the seed crop. We examined whether self‐pollinated fruits were aborted selectively in a partially self‐compatible population of Banksia spinulosa. Inflorescences were divided in half and pollinated with cross pollen on both sides, self pollen on both sides or cross pollen on one side and self pollen on the other. Seed production was reduced significantly by 38% on fully self‐pollinated compared to fully cross‐pollinated inflorescences, indicating partial self‐incompatibility or inbreeding depression. On inflorescences pollinated with both cross and self pollen, selfed seed set was reduced by 63% compared to crossed seed set. On the selfed half of these inflorescences, fewer fruits and seeds were produced, and more fruits had aborted seeds than on randomly selected halves of fully self‐pollinated inflorescences. These results suggest that self‐fertilized embryos were developed in the absence of outcrossed progeny but were selectively aborted when outcrossed progeny were present on inflorescences. To determine the amount of outcrossing occurring in the study population, outcrossing rates t of naturally pollinated plants were examined by electrophoretic assessment of progeny arrays. Values of I did not differ significantly from one, indicating complete outcrossing. High outcrossing, despite the high probability of self pollen receipt under natural conditions, is consistent with the conclusion that selective abortion occurs in B. spinulosa.
